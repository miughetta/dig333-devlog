## Week 1

### Context

The TEDxBigApple Talk titled "Physicality and Conviviality" by Tom Igoe dicusses physical computing as computation from the point of view of that people do in the physical world. This principal is elaborated on in the context of ardunio, which was built on the idea that anyone can utilze the technology. The talk as a whole emphasizes themes of interdiscplinary work and openness within the community of engineers. This is shown in the talk's ending quote, "the devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them." These ideas remind me a lot of my work within an interdiscplinary STEM major at Davidson, but I find it interesting the ways that material sciences such as Biology almost safeguard information while computer science celebrates this immediate disperion of information. The talk also touches on the dangers of this kind of open source material, making me wonder who is in charge of regulating public policy around such hardware? In general, in the era of the internet, if this kind of high preformance technology is accessible to everyone, who is able to ensure that electronics are not being used for harm? 

### Experiments

The Command Line: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I utilzed a variety of code on the command line in my Mac's terminal. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward:
        <li>whoami: displays the username</li>
        <li>pwd: displays the working directory</li>
        <li>ls: displays the contents of the working directory</li>
        <li>ls -a: displays all files including those with ., which are hidden</li>
        <li>cd: changes to a new directory</li>
        <li>mkdir: makes a directory</li>
        <li>touch file.txt: creates a new file</li>
        <li>vim file.txt: edits a file</li>
            <li>i: inserts</li>
            <li>:wq exits</li>
        <li>clear: clear the terminal screen</li>
        <li>python file.py: runs the python file</li>
    Of these lines of code, I believe the most important thing I learned was how to edit a file with the vim editor. While I have expirence with the command line, that is not something I have much practice with. My vim work looked like such: <br>
    <img width="763" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 10 21 33 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59931466/151910324-4facde02-b276-4dba-9a09-dc4021cd5242.png">

    Quiz Question: How can you autocomplete commands once you start typing?

Git & Github Desktop: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I reviewed installation, workflow and basic commands of both git and github. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward: <br>
        <li>git commit -m "message here": gets files ready</li>
        <li>git add . : picks the files, the . prepares all changed files</li>
        <li>git push: pushes the files from the computer onto github</li>
        <li>git pull: pulls the files from github onto the computer</li>
        <li>git status: see the status of the files on the computer in relation to github</li>
        <li>git merge: merges changes from the a branch into yours</li>
        <li>git checkout file: checout a branch to inspect changes</li>
        <li>forking: create a copy of an existing repo</li>
        <li>git diff: quickly compares two branches to see thier differences</li>
    Of these lines of code, I was unaware of the git diff line and think this is the most importnat thing I have learned in this tutorial. It was also important to see that the workflow can be vizualized as such: <br>
    <img width="512" alt="Screen Shot 2022-01-31 at 10 13 10 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59931466/151910284-048422a5-bac7-4379-a435-e187c739f246.png">

    Quiz Question: What are the benefits to using github for a project?

## Week 2

### Context

The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World: <br>
This website article By Internet of Shit dicusses the concept of connected devices. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of objects embedded with the ability to exchange and collect data within a system. While this allows for the advancement of technology in theory, issues of security, privacy, and authenticity when there is no agreed upon regulation for building connected system. This concept was summarized in the article as follows: "to leverage the power of the IoT responsibly and profitably, you need to develop and implement your own IoT technologies, solutions, and applications." This makes me think of the lack of regulation on the internet as a whole. How can regulation within deviced be achieved? Are other aspects of the internet/technology needing regulation?


The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours <br>
This website article by Sanjay Sarma dicusses the idea that everything is connected on the internet wheather it improves the technology or not. Devices do not always need to be connected but the idea that such cinnection makes them better drives this. This makes internet reach more "intimate" parts of our lives leaving questions about what obligation the companies have to creating devices that will achieve longevity in these spaces? In what ways will these devices try to monetize these intimate aspects of our lives? This makes me think of the monetization of ads especially on google, where our information is stored aggresively to market us as consumers. The reading also specifically askes: "when everything’s connected and nobody’s responsible for the consequences, what happens?" 

### Experiments
#### Platt
1. Taste the power: This experiment has the user put their tongue to the end of a nine volt battery to create a circuit with the body. Having a wet tongue lowers the resistance in the circuit and allows more elctric current to flow causing a greater tingle in the tongue than when it is dry. This difference can be measured with a meter. This concept of resistance is the most iumportant thing I learned through this experiment. Quiz Question: Does water lower or increase resistance? 

2. Abuse a battery: This experiment has the user short circuit a battery by connecting the ends of the battery using wires. This is becasue the fuse melted to protect the rest of the circuit from how much current was flowing through. The connection between voltage (volts), resistance (ohms), and amerage (amps) was the most important thing I learned. It can be described through an analogy to water flowing out of a hole, where voltage is the pressure, amerage is the rate of flow, and resistance is the diameter of the hole. The flow of current can be like water from a faucet in a direct current or the flow can b a pulse in an alternating current. Quiz Question: Does a battery have direct or alternating current?

3. Your First Circuit: This experiment has the user decode/check resistors, use them to build a circuit, and light an LED. This allows for the user to light up an LED at varying brightness. We were able to measure that all of the batteries in a pack were 4.7 volts, and it took 13.83 volts to short the LED (aka 3 battery packs) .The most improtant thing I learned in this experiment was what the different colored lines on resistors meant. Quiz Question: Why might we use a resistor in a circuit? 

4. Variable Resistance: This experiment has the user control resistance in a circuit using potentiometer. This device "protects" the LED from a source such as a 9 volt battery so that it is not destroyed. Notably, it has no polarity unlike an LED, and thus does not having a right way around to be connected. This expirement allowed the user to check voltage across parts of a circuit, how to measure current in a circuit, and how to create circuits in both series and parallel using LEDs. The most improtant thing I learned in this experiment was Ohm's Law, which tells us how much resistance we need in the circuit: voltage = current * resistance. We were able to calculated the resistance for a 2 volt LED with 0.02 amps as being 125 ohms using Ohm’s law. This also helped us understand what happens to current and voltaghe throughout the circuit. Quiz Question: Why might we use Ohm's law in this experiment?

5. Let's Make a Battery: Read this section but don't do the lemon experiment. The relationship between currents, volts, and watts can be described through the equation voltage = current * resistance. When batteries are in series, voltage increases, but when the batteries are in parallel that is not the case. When batteries are in parallel the total current capacity increases by decreasing the total resistance. The differences between series and parallel are the most important thing I learned in this section. Quiz Question: What is the equation that describes the relationship between voltage, current, and resistance?

## Week 3

### Context
THE CRITICAL ENGINEERING MANIFESTO: <br>
This document dicusses ways to be a critical engineer through ten main points. These suggestions are meant to guide people while working on engineering projects such as code in order to make an ethical product. This bring up the idea that engineers are responsible to provide an ethical product for users. This is summarized in the first statement (statement 0): "it is the work of the Critical Engineer to study and exploit this language, exposing its influence." This raises questions about to what extent engineers are responsible for the way their products affect users?

Artist Profile: Julian Oliver: <br>
This article gives a profile on Julian Oliver who published the Critical Manifesto. This interview asks questions about this manifesto and engineering projects that he had been a part of. In this way, Jul;ian Oliver dicusses the ways in which he has been woring creatively with technology throughou this career. This sentiment can be summerized through the quote: "I choose whatever material I need to manifest the work." I like this idea as often we approach a problem and then choose the methods, a direction and then a programming language, but by choosing materials first we can approach solutions in a different way. This makes me wonder what materials we might not be considering in the fields of computer science or digital studies?

Adam Curtis All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 1 (2011): <br>
This video is one in a series of films that discusses the idea of earth being colonized by the machines. This is particularly chilling as we notice the ways technology surrounds us every day. This installment takes heavy inspiration from Ayn Rand's philosophical views before tying in political influence. The ideology of this documentary is summarized as follows: "The original promise of the Californian Ideology was that the computers would liberate us from all the old forms of political control and we would become Randian heroes in control of our own destiny. Instead, today we feel the opposite, that we are helpless components in a global system, a system that is controlled by a rigid logic that we are powerless to challenge or to change." This connects to the idea of grey goo, the apocalyptic scenario of nanotechnology self-replicating until they destroy the biosphere. This makes me wonder what other ways, and possibly more realistic ways, technology could "rebel" against humanity?

## Week 4

### Context
<!-- Philip K. Dick Pay for the Printer (1956) and The Preserving Machine (1953) -->

“Pay for the Printer” is a science fiction short story written by Philip K. Dick. This apocalyptic story follows a group of remaining humas from the dwindling population, who rely on the presence of the alien species Biltong to build replicas of existing human products from “before the war.” Humans know nothing about the tools that they use, and this sad sentiment is reflected in the dialogue: “I was driving back home when my car began to break down. I looked under the hood, but who knows anything about motors? That's not our business.” (4-5) However, throughout the story these characters become interested in and learn to build their own tools. This story concept makes me think of how people advance tools to a point that most of them can not build those tools, but rather need tools to build them. I wonder if we are already past this stage in society or if we are getting there?

<br>

“The Preserving Machine” is a science fiction short story written by Philip K. Dick. This story focuses on Doc Labyrinth, who fears for the downfall of civilization, especially classical music. He thus builds a machine which converts music into living animals, which can survive on their own. However, over time these animals undergo evolution, and when converted back to their musical state, are unlike their original scores. Ignoring the conversations that could have about biology, this makes me think about technological advancement and how, when you release your work to the public, it is subject to change and become something you didn’t intend it to. This makes me wonder what technology we use that perhaps was invented with a different purpose? This idea is summarized in the short story in the following quote: “Even though this method failed, some other may work; something that we can't foresee or predict now may come along, some day.” (10)

<br>
<!-- Adam Curtis All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 2 (2011) -->

This video is one in a series of films that discusses the idea of earth being colonized by the machines. More specifically, this installment looks at nature from a technological stance. This is mostly done by exploring cybernetics and systems theory. This makes me think about greater intersections between nature, humans, and technology. Do our creations automatically reflect our environment? Thus, I wonder how much technology can, should, or is modeled off nature? I particularly liked the quote: “But what we are discovering is that if we see ourselves as components in a system, that it is very difficult to change the world.”

## Week 5

### Context

Brian Merchant Everything That’s Inside Your iPhone Motherboard (2017) <br>

Everything That’s Inside Your Iphone by Brian Merchant looks at the proportion of components within an iphone. This is done by pulverizing the phone, weighing the elements, and determining the cost of each. This is then related to mining at Cerro Rico, which is known for its hazardous conditions and child labor. However, much of the products from these mines fuels the iphone industry, “so: metal mined by men and children wielding the most primitive of tools in one of the world's largest and oldest continuously running mines—the same mine that bankrolled the sixteenth century's richest empire—wound up inside some of today's most cutting-edge devices.” This makes me consider the ways we generally do not know where things in our everyday lives come from. Under the capitalistic society we live in, is there a way to ethically obtain these substances? What can we do about it as consumers?<br>

One Man's Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch (2009) images <br>

One Man’s Nearly Impossible Quest to Make a Toaster From Scratch by Rachel Swaby follows Thomas Thwaites adventure in engineering. After deconstructing a toaster, Thwaites was able to observe the pieces of and thus reverse engineer the machine himself. Simplifying the process, Thwaites noticed five main elements,steel, mica, plastic, copper and nickel, within the machines. Thus, he traveled on his own to acquire these substances and then mold them into the appliance we use every day (to partial success), which overall “illuminated just how far removed our everyday items are from the raw materials that go into them.” This does make me wonder what kind of work goes into each appliance. It reminds me as a programmer how most people do not know the coding that goes into their everyday interfaces. What if anything would be possible for us Davidson students to make from scratch?<br>

Adam Curtis All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 3 (2011)<br>

All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace Part 3 is titled The Monkey in the Machine and the Machine in the Monkey, and broadly looks into the selfish gene theory. Such a theory believes that humans are machines, but instead of driven by code, they are driven by their genes. Such genes could thus explain every human behavior from sucide, to murder, to goodness, and genocide. The founder of this theory, Bill Hamilton, also took his theory to support eugenics movements. However, this film counters these ideologies by arguing that “we have embraced aa fatalistic philosophy of us as helpless computing machines to both excuse and explain our political failure to change the world.” The idea of genes as code is also fascinating in terms of a data science point of view. There is much research currently on DNA data storage and the ability for large archives to be kept within DNA as a way to save space and move forward in computer science since DNA is the most efficient way we as humans have to store such data. It makes me wonder then how we categorize a machine? What are the implications of the word that would be beneficial in relation to humans and what implications would be harmful? <br>


### Experiments

<!-- List each Platt experiment / Monk recipe outcome, adding notes, photos, schematics, captions to show your work. -->

1. Name of the experiment
    1. Text, photos, etc.
    1. Describe the most important thing you learned (to share in class)
    1. Write a quiz question (which we will discuss in class)


Platt - Ch2 Switching (41-91) Experiments 6-10 <br>

Necessary Items for Chapter 2 <br>
    - Identify pliers, wire strippers, cutters <br>
    - Use wire strippers to strip insulation from "hook up" (solid core) or stranded wire <br>
    - Identify electrical components: switches, relays, trimpots, transistors, capacitors <br>
    - Watch: Collin's Lab Electronics Tools (9:27) <br>
Experiment 6: Very Simple Switching (p.50) <br>
    - Identify the "pole" of a switch: center terminal of a switch <br>
    - Describe the difference between a SPST and SPDT:  A SPST is a single-pole or single throw switch. This type of switch has two terminals and are on/off. SPDT are single-pole double-throw switches. This type of switch can be flipped to make two possibel connections. <br>
    - Use a multimeter and a switch to check continuity <br>

    - Read a basic electronics schematic that shows LEDs, resistors, power supply, and a switch using Tinkercad or pencil / paper. <br>
    - Watch: Collin's Lab Switches (5:38) <br>
Experiment 7: Investigating a Relay <br>
    - Read information from a component (JQC-T78-DC5V) to find its datasheet or a supplier page <br>
    - Use Tinkercad to build and test (simulate) a circuit containing a relay: we did this with a real circuit: <br>
    <img width="486" alt="Screen Shot 2022-02-24 at 8 07 13 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59931466/155635167-3e0ad31f-8327-457a-a8e5-7c44224dbf4c.png"><br>
    ⚠️ Don't break open the relay but do examine the images in the book. <br>
Experiment 8: A Relay Oscillator <br>
    - Use wire strippers to make jumper wire to "power" a breadboard. <br>
    ![IMG_5112](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/59931466/155637004-e6f136d0-792f-4e98-82dc-766f26a716f7.jpeg) <br>
    - Explain the operation of a capacitor using an analogy where water = electricity: Capacitors store and release energy in alternate current, so it would be as if in the middle of a hose there was someone standing there putting there foot down in alternating motions reducing the flow.<br>
    ⚠️ Explain why large capacitors are dangerous: they store large amounts of energy that can be dangerous.<br>
    ⚠️ Explain why polarized capacitors are dangerous:  They can explode.<br>
    - Contrast the charge / discharge operation of different sizes (e.g. 1µF, 10µF, 100µF, 1,000µF) of capacitors: the bigger the capacitor, the more energy it can store.<br>
    - List common fault-tracing procedures for identifying circuit errors, such as incorrect voltage, orientation, component values, or connections: check voltages, check placement, check component orientation, check connections, check component values, check for damage, anc check yourself. <br>
    - Watch: Collin's Lab Capacitors (8:00) <br>
Experiment 9: Time and Capacitors <br>
    - Capacitors <br>
Experiment 10: Transistor Switching <br>
Experiment 11: Light and Sound <br>
    - Watch: Collin's Lab Diodes (7:26), Transistors (8:56) <br>
