## Week 1

### Context

The TEDxBigApple Talk titled "Physicality and Conviviality" by Tom Igoe dicusses physical computing as computation from the point of view of that people do in the physical world. This principal is elaborated on in the context of ardunio, which was built on the idea that anyone can utilze the technology. The talk as a whole emphasizes themes of interdiscplinary work and openness within the community of engineers. This is shown in the talk's ending quote, "the devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them." These ideas remind me a lot of my work within an interdiscplinary STEM major at Davidson, but I find it interesting the ways that material sciences such as Biology almost safeguard information while computer science celebrates this immediate disperion of information. The talk also touches on the dangers of this kind of open source material, making me wonder who is in charge of regulating public policy around such hardware? In general, in the era of the internet, if this kind of high preformance technology is accessible to everyone, who is able to ensure that electronics are not being used for harm? 

### Experiments

The Command Line: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I utilzed a variety of code on the command line in my Mac's terminal. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward:
        <li>whoami: displays the username</li>
        <li>pwd: displays the working directory</li>
        <li>ls: displays the contents of the working directory</li>
        <li>ls -a: displays all files including those with ., which are hidden</li>
        <li>cd: changes to a new directory</li>
        <li>mkdir: makes a directory</li>
        <li>touch file.txt: creates a new file</li>
        <li>vim file.txt: edits a file</li>
            <li>i: inserts</li>
            <li>:wq exits</li>
        <li>clear: clear the terminal screen</li>
        <li>python file.py: runs the python file</li>
    Of these lines of code, I believe the most important thing I learned was how to edit a file with the vim editor. While I have expirence with the command line, that is not something I have much practice with.

    Quiz Question: How can you autocomplete commands once you start typing?

Git & Github Desktop: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I reviewed installation, workflow and basic commands of both git and github. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward: <br>
        <li>git commit -m "message here": gets files ready</li>
        <li>git add . : picks the files, the . prepares all changed files</li>
        <li>git push: pushes the files from the computer onto github</li>
        <li>git pull: pulls the files from github onto the computer</li>
        <li>git status: see the status of the files on the computer in relation to github</li>
        <li>git merge: merges changes from the a branch into yours</li>
        <li>git checkout file: checout a branch to inspect changes</li>
        <li>forking: create a copy of an existing repo</li>
        <li>git diff: quickly compares two branches to see thier differences</li>
    Of these lines of code, I was unaware of the git diff line and think this is the most importnat thing I have learned in this tutorial.

    Quiz Question: What are the benefits to using github for a project?
