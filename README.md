## Week 1

### Context

The TEDxBigApple Talk titled "Physicality and Conviviality" by Tom Igoe dicusses physical computing as computation from the point of view of that people do in the physical world. This principal is elaborated on in the context of ardunio, which was built on the idea that anyone can utilze the technology. The talk as a whole emphasizes themes of interdiscplinary work and openness within the community of engineers. This is shown in the talk's ending quote, "the devices that we make and the devices that we use, what they do matters less than the relationships that we make through them." These ideas remind me a lot of my work within an interdiscplinary STEM major at Davidson, but I find it interesting the ways that material sciences such as Biology almost safeguard information while computer science celebrates this immediate disperion of information. The talk also touches on the dangers of this kind of open source material, making me wonder who is in charge of regulating public policy around such hardware? In general, in the era of the internet, if this kind of high preformance technology is accessible to everyone, who is able to ensure that electronics are not being used for harm? 

### Experiments

The Command Line: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I utilzed a variety of code on the command line in my Mac's terminal. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward:
        <li>whoami: displays the username</li>
        <li>pwd: displays the working directory</li>
        <li>ls: displays the contents of the working directory</li>
        <li>ls -a: displays all files including those with ., which are hidden</li>
        <li>cd: changes to a new directory</li>
        <li>mkdir: makes a directory</li>
        <li>touch file.txt: creates a new file</li>
        <li>vim file.txt: edits a file</li>
            <li>i: inserts</li>
            <li>:wq exits</li>
        <li>clear: clear the terminal screen</li>
        <li>python file.py: runs the python file</li>
    Of these lines of code, I believe the most important thing I learned was how to edit a file with the vim editor. While I have expirence with the command line, that is not something I have much practice with. My vim work looked like such: <br>

    Quiz Question: How can you autocomplete commands once you start typing?

Git & Github Desktop: <br>
    To complete this tutorial, I reviewed installation, workflow and basic commands of both git and github. The following phrases are important commands that I believe I will rely on moving forward: <br>
        <li>git commit -m "message here": gets files ready</li>
        <li>git add . : picks the files, the . prepares all changed files</li>
        <li>git push: pushes the files from the computer onto github</li>
        <li>git pull: pulls the files from github onto the computer</li>
        <li>git status: see the status of the files on the computer in relation to github</li>
        <li>git merge: merges changes from the a branch into yours</li>
        <li>git checkout file: checout a branch to inspect changes</li>
        <li>forking: create a copy of an existing repo</li>
        <li>git diff: quickly compares two branches to see thier differences</li>
    Of these lines of code, I was unaware of the git diff line and think this is the most importnat thing I have learned in this tutorial. It was also important to see that the workflow can be vizualized as such: <br>

    Quiz Question: What are the benefits to using github for a project?

## Week 2

### Context

The Internet of Things: Roadmap to a Connected World: <br>
This website article By Internet of Shit dicusses the concept of connected devices. The Internet of Things (IoT) is a network of objects embedded with the ability to exchange and collect data within a system. While this allows for the advancement of technology in theory, issues of security, privacy, and authenticity when there is no agreed upon regulation for building connected system. This concept was summarized in the article as follows: "to leverage the power of the IoT responsibly and profitably, you need to develop and implement your own IoT technologies, solutions, and applications." This makes me think of the lack of regulation on the internet as a whole. How can regulation within deviced be achieved? Are other aspects of the internet/technology needing regulation?


The Internet of Things has a dirty little secret: it's not really yours <br>
This website article by Sanjay Sarma dicusses the idea that everything is connected on the internet wheather it improves the technology or not. Devices do not always need to be connected but the idea that such cinnection makes them better drives this. This makes internet reach more "intimate" parts of our lives leaving questions about what obligation the companies have to creating devices that will achieve longevity in these spaces? In what ways will these devices try to monetize these intimate aspects of our lives? This makes me think of the monetization of ads especially on google, where our information is stored aggresively to market us as consumers. The reading also specifically askes: "when everything’s connected and nobody’s responsible for the consequences, what happens?" 



### Experiments
1. Taste the power: This experiment has the user put their tongue to the end of a nine volt battery to create a circuit with the body. Having a wet tongue lowers the resistance in the circuit and allows more elctric current to flow causing a greater tingle in the tongue than when it is dry. This difference can be measured with a meter. This concept of resistance is the most iumportant thing I learned through this experiment. Quiz Question: Does water lower or increase resistance? 

2. Abuse a battery: This experiment has the user short circuit a battery by connecting the ends of the battery using wires. This is becasue the fuse melted to protect the rest of the circuit from how much current was flowing through. The connection between voltage (volts), resistance (ohms), and amerage (amps) was the most important thing I learned. It can be described through an analogy to water flowing out of a hole, where voltage is the pressure, amerage is the rate of flow, and resistance is the diameter of the hole. The flow of current can be like water from a faucet in a direct current or the flow can b a pulse in an alternating current. Quiz Question: Does a battery have direct or alternating current?

3. Your First Circuit: This experiment has the user decode/check resistors, use them to build a circuit, and light an LED. This allows for the user to light up an LED at varying brightness. The most improtant thing I learned in this experiment was what the different colored lines on resistors meant. Quiz Question: Why might we use a resistor in a circuit? 

4. Variable Resistance: This experiment has the user control resistance in a circuit using potentiometer. This device "protects" the LED from a source such as a 9 volt battery so that it is not destroyed. Notably, it has no polarity unlike an LED, and thus does not having a right way around to be connected. This expirement allowed the user to check voltage across parts of a circuit, how to measure current in a circuit, and how to create circuits in both series and parallel using LEDs. The most improtant thing I learned in this experiment was Ohm's Law, which tells us how much resistance we need in the circuit: voltage = current * resistance. This also helped us understand what happens to current and voltaghe throughout the circuit. Quiz Question: Why might we use Ohm's law in this experiment?

5. Collin's Lab: This experiment has the user follow four videos. Multimeters (7:22) discusses how to measure resistance, voltage, and current; LEDs (5:29) dicusses who invented LEDs, how to use them, and how to make your own; Resistors (5:08) demonstrates the resistor in circuitry; Ohm's Law (7:09) introduces the equation voltage = current * resistance. The most improtant thing I learned in this experiment was how to put all these components together. Quiz Question: What equation connects voltage, current, and resistance?
